    Description
        We are going to be creating websites for She Codes News! Hurrah! You are to create a news website that allows users to read news stories, and authors to create them.

    Project Requirements:
        Starter files are provided for this project. In the first session working on this project, as a class, we will go through those starter files and get everyone’s project up and running. Part 1 and Part 2 also have setup steps that we will do as a class. We strongly recommend that you refrain from starting Part 1 or Part 2 until after we have completed the setup in class.

    Submission Requirements:
        Please submit a txt file containing the following:
            ● A link to the GitHub repository containing the code for your project. Include a screenshots directory in this folder with a screenshot each completed page on your site.
            ● A link to your deployed website.
